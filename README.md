# Week 1 Challenge

## Description

This week 1 challenge gave me an opportunity to study and apply semantic elements while still retaining how the website would look. Studying the html elements along with referring to the css file to match how it affects the edited html.

I also added alt to images and icons and made sure heading attributes fall in sequential order.

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

The page is responsive both keyboard and mouse navigation. CSS file is commented as what I see fit.
